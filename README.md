# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Projects
These are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Late Payments Data Analysis

In this project, I investigated the impact of Euribor 12-month interest rates, diesel prices, and bankruptcies on payment delays of road freight transportation companies. It is important to note that the findings of this study are based on a sample from a single company. As such, the generalizability of the results to other similar companies may be limited. Using time-series regression analysis, I found that an increase in diesel prices resulted in a decrease in payment delays. However, there was no strong evidence to support the alternative hypotheses for Euribor's 12-month interest rates and bankruptcies. I also used classification models to predict whether an invoice will be paid late or on time. The kNN model with k=3 had the best overall performance, followed by the logistic regression model. 

Tools and Technologies: python, excel, jupyter notebooks

### Database Creation Project

For the database creation project in Databases course, I began by creating an UML diagram and relational model. The model included tables such as "Toimenpide", "Huolto", "Varaosa", "LaiteVaraus", "Laitekappale", "Laitetyyppi", "Maksumuistutus", "Lasku", "Huoltovaraus", "Työntekijä", "Poissaolo", "Asiakas", "Auto", "Omistaja", and "Omistaa". I then created the database based on this model, inserted values into the tables, and checked the integrity constraints.

Tools and Technologies: SQLite
